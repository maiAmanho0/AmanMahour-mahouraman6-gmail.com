// Per-request context: turn a bearer token into an authenticated caller.
//
// This is the ONLY place that decides "who is asking". Everything downstream works
// from ctx. Two rules matter here and both are load-bearing:
//
//   1. The token's `org` claim IS the org you are allowed to address. If a request
//      names a different org in the path, that org is INVISIBLE — 404, not 403
//      (PERMISSIONS.md §6). Cross-org access is structurally impossible rather than
//      filtered, because the token cannot name another org.
//
//   2. Freshness is checked against the membership's perm_version. A stale token gets
//      TOKEN_STALE so the client can refresh. This is what makes a role change take
//      effect on the NEXT request rather than at token expiry (D11, Option A).
